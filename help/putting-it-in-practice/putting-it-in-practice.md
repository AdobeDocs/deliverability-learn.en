# Putting it in practice - Overview

As we’ve covered in this guide, there are many nuances to deliverability and following best practices. 

There are four key pillars to success:

1. Set proper expectations during sign-up and have a good sign-up process that prevents bad addresses.
2. Provide relevant and timely content.
3. Maintain your lists by removing addresses that become bad.
4. Monitor, test, and adjust as you go.

If you’re ever unclear or need assistance with an issue, please contact your Adobe deliverability consultant or deliverability expert for help.
