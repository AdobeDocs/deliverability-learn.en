# Third-party monitoring tools

## Signal Spam {#signal-spam}

[Signal Spam](https://www.signal-spam.fr/) is a French service which offers anonymized feedback loop reporting for French ISPs (Orange, SFR).

* This service allows you to follow the reputation of the French ISPs and track customers' activity evolution.

* Signal Spam also provides direct complaints that end users log through a dedicated interface. Those complaints are then quarantined from the email address database.
