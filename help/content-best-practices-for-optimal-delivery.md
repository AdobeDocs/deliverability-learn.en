# Content best practices for optimal deliverability

Content is key. You’ve already read our perspective on relevance, but here are a few additional tips to optimizing your deliverability when it comes to content:

* Avoid too large of an HTML file. Stay under 100KB, but try to stay between 60 and 80KB to prevent slow delivery.
* Use alt tags to your advantage. Alt tags live within the image code of the HTML and display text if the image isn’t visible or loading. Rather than having a simple description like “product shot,” you might want to say something more compelling like, “Buy now and get 30% off.”
* Avoid too many images. Most ISPs now block images by default. You want to have a way to capture your audience without the images enabled so they then enable them.
