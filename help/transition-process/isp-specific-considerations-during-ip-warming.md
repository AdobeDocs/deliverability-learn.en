# ISP-specific considerations during IP warming

ISPs have different rules and different ways of looking at their traffic. For example, Gmail is one of the most sophisticated ISPs because they look at engagement very strictly (opens and clicks) in addition to all other reputation measures. This requires a customized plan that only targets the highest engaged users at the onset. Other ISPs may require the same as well. Work with your Adobe deliverability consultant for a specific plan.

See the [Internet service provider specifics](/help/internet-service-provider-specifics/overview.md) section for more information on the important differences between the following selected group of providers:

* [Gmail](/help/internet-service-provider-specifics/gmail.md)
* [Microsoft (Hotmail, Outlook, Windows Live etc.)](/help/internet-service-provider-specifics/microsoft.md)
* [Verizon Media Group (Yahoo, AOL, Verizon, etc.)](/help/internet-service-provider-specifics/verizon-media-group.md)
