# First impressions — List collection and welcome emails

When looking to build a new relationship, making a good first impression is crucial. Without it, nothing else you say or do may be given a chance. The relationship between a brand and those choosing to interact with them is no different. Everything starts somewhere. And when it comes to running an email program, it starts with collecting email addresses and welcoming those sub-scribers to your program. Let’s check out how you can set yourself up for running a successful email program by making a good first impression in those areas.

## Address collection and list growth

The best sources of new email addresses are direct sources like sign-ups on your website or in physical stores. In those situations, you can control the experience to make sure it’s positive and that the subscriber is actually interested in getting email from your brand.

Some notes about these sign-up methods:

**Physical store** list collection can present challenges due to verbal or written address inputs causing misspelling in the addresses. Sending a confirmation email as quickly as possible after in-store sign-ups is recommended.

The most common form of **website sign-up** is “single opt-in.” This should be the absolute mini-mum standard you use to acquire email addresses. It’s when the holder of a specific email ad-dress grants a sender permission to send them marketing emails, usually by submitting the ad-dress via a web form or in-store signups. While it’s possible to run a successful email campaign using this method, it can be the cause of some problems.

* Unconfirmed email addresses can have typos or be malformed, incorrect, or maliciously used. Typos and malformed addresses cause high bounce rates, which can and do provoke blocks issued by ISPs or IP reputation loss.
* Malicious submission of known spam traps (sometimes called “list poisoning”) can cause huge problems with delivery and reputation if the owner of that trap takes action. It’s impossible to know if the recipient truly wants to be added to a marketing list without a confirmation. This makes it equally impossible to set the recipient's expectations and can lead to increased spam complaints—and sometimes blacklisting if the collected email happens to be a spam-trap.
  
For guidance on how to minimize the issues presented in both physical store and single opt-in, go to the Data quality and hygiene section in this guide for the details and benefits of double opt-in.

Subscribers often use throw-away addresses, expired addresses, or addresses that aren’t theirs in order to get what they want from a website but also avoid getting added to marketing lists. When this happens, marketers’ lists can result in having a high number of hard bounces, high spam complaint rates, and subscribers who don’t click, open, or positively engage with emails. This can be seen as a red flag for mailbox providers and ISPs.

### Sign-up forms

In addition to all of the fields for the data you want to collect about your new subscribers, which can encourage more relevant connections with your customers, there are a few other things you should do with your sign-up form on the website.

* Set clear expectations with the subscriber that they’re agreeing to receive email, what they will receive, and how often they will receive it.
* Add options allowing the subscriber to select the frequency or type of communications that they receive. This allows you to know the subscriber’s preferences from the start so you can provide the best possible experience for your new customer.
* Balance the risk of losing the subscriber’s interest during the sign-up process by asking for as much information as possible. Things like their birthday, location, interests, and so on, which might help you send more customized content. Every brand’s subscribers will have different expectations and tolerance thresholds, so testing is key to find the right balance for your situation.

### Data quality and hygiene

Collecting data is only part of the challenge. You also need to make sure the data is both accurate and usable. You should have basic format filters in place. An email address isn’t valid if it doesn’t include an “@” or “.” for example. Be sure to not allow common alias addresses, which are also referred to as role accounts (like “info,” “admin,” “sales,” “support,” and so on). Role ac-counts can present risk because, by their nature, the recipient contains a group of people as op-posed to a single subscriber. Expectations and tolerance can vary within a group, which risks complaints, varying engagement, unsubscribes, and general confusion.

Here are a few solutions to common issues you may run into with your email address data:

**[!DNL Double opt-in (DOI)]**
[!DNL Double opt-in (DOI)] is considered the best deliverability practice by most email experts. If you’re having trouble with spam traps or complaints on your welcome emails, DOI is a good way to ensure that the subscriber receiving your emails is the person who actually signed up for your email program and wants to receive your emails.

DOI consists of sending a confirmation email to the subscriber’s email address who has just signed up to your email program which contains a link that must be clicked to confirm consent. With this acquisition method, if the subscriber doesn’t confirm, the sender wouldn’t send them additional emails. Let new subscribers know you’re doing this on the website, encouraging them to complete the sign-up before continuing. This method does see a reduction in the number of sign-ups, but those who do sign-up tend to be highly engaged and stay for the long term, and it usually results in a much higher ROI for the sender.

**Hidden field**
Applying a hidden field on your sign-up form is a great way to differentiate automated bot sign-ups from real human subscribers. Because the data field isn’t visible, hidden in the HTML code, a bot will enter data where a human wouldn’t. Using this method, you can build rules to suppress any sign-up that includes data populated in that hidden field.

**[!DNL reCAPTCHA]**
[!DNL reCAPTCHA] is a validation method you can use to reduce the chances the subscriber is a bot and not a real person. There are various versions, some of which contain keyword identification or images. Some versions are more effective than others, and what you gain in security and deliverability issue prevention is much higher than any negative impact to conversions.

### Legal guidelines

Consult your lawyers to interpret local and national laws concerning email. Remember that email laws widely from amongst different countries and in some cases different local regions within a country.

* Be sure to collect a subscriber’s location information so that you’re compliant with the sub-scriber’s country laws. Without that detail, you may be limited in how you can market to the subscriber.
* Any relevant laws are generally determined by the location of the recipient, not the sender. So you’ll need to know and follow the laws for any country where you might have a sub-scriber.
* It’s often difficult to know with total certainty the country of residence for the subscriber. Data provided by the customer may be out of date, and pixel location data may be inaccurate due to VPN or image warehousing, like with Gmail and Yahoo. When in doubt, it’s usually safest to apply the strictest possible laws and guidelines.

### Other non-recommended list collection methods

There are many other ways to collect addresses, each with its own opportunities, challenges, and drawbacks. We don’t recommend these in general, since use is often restricted via provider acceptable use policies. We’ll take a look at a few common examples, so you can learn the dangers to help you limit or avoid the risks:

**Buy or rent a list**
There are a lot of types of email addresses out there. Primary email, work emails, school emails, secondary emails, and inactive emails to name a few. The types of addresses collected and shared out through these methods are rarely primary email accounts, which is where nearly all engagement and purchase activity occurs.

If you’re lucky, you get secondary accounts, where people will look for deals and offers when they’re ready to shop for something. This usually results in low engagement levels—if any. If you’re not lucky, the list will be full of inactive emails, which may now be spam traps. Often, you get a mix of both secondary and inactive emails. In general, the quality of these types of lists will do more harm than good to an email program. This practice is prohibited by the [!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign Acceptable Use Policy].

**List append**
These are customers who have chosen to engage with your brand, which is great. But they chose to engage through a method other than email (in-store, social media, etc.). They may not be receptive to getting an unrequested email from you and may also be concerned about how you gained their email address since they didn’t provide it. This method has a risk of turning a customer or potential customer who engaged with your brand into a detractor who no longer trusts your brand and will go to your competition instead. This practice is prohibited by the [!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign Acceptable Use Policy].

**Trade show or other event collection**
Collecting addresses at a booth or through another official, clearly branded method can be useful. The risk is that many events like this collect all addresses and distribute them through the event promoter or host. This means the users of these email addresses never specifically request-ed to receive emails from your brand. These subscribers are likely to complain and mark your mail as spam, and they may not have provided accurate contact information.

**Sweepstakes**
Sweepstakes provide large numbers of email addresses quickly. But these subscribers want the prize, not your emails. They may not have even paid attention to the name of who would be reaching out to them. These subscribers are likely to complain and mark your mail as spam, and they may be unlikely to ever engage or make a purchase.

## Welcome emails

### Developing a welcome strategy

Your welcome emails are the biggest foundational factor in driving a successful email program. On average, subscribers who engage with your welcome emails are more than four times as likely to continue engaging with other emails you send if you send a single welcome email. Plus, they’re 12 times more likely to continue engaging if you send a series of three welcome emails.

Regardless of your strategy, subscribers who don’t receive a welcome email at all or who don’t connect with your welcome message are unlikely to convert into happy subscribers. A well-planned and carefully crafted welcome plan—that includes thinking about the what, when, and who of your messages—leads to a positive first impression and the best path to long term subscriber satisfaction.

### Key elements

Here are a few key elements to consider when building your welcome email or emails:

**Send your message ASAP**
If you’re offering a promotion, your new subscriber will likely be waiting on the website to get the email before making their purchase. A delay of even 5–10 minutes here can mean a lost sale. Even if you don’t have a promotion, they’re currently expressing interest in your brand. So you need to engage with them while their interest is peaked instead of taking a chance at a later time.

**Create strong subject lines and pre-headers**
You need to not only thank them for signing up—you also need to catch their attention and give them a reason to want to open the email. Don’t forget to capitalize on the extra room in the pre-header to make your case.

**Set expectations**
Make it clear that your focus is on a positive experience for them. State what they should expect from you and how often to expect it. Providing a way for them to easily manage their experience (i.e., a link to a preference center) is also a good idea. Also consider adding links to prior content so that users can reference the content they are subscribing to.

**Let them get a feel for your brand**
Every brand has a voice. Let yours be clearly displayed in your welcome email. This helps your new subscriber connect more with the brand and avoids them feeling surprised by a change in style with later emails.

**Keep it concise**
You have a lot to say and an eager ear in your new subscriber. But your first message should be short, simple, to the point, and not overwhelming.

**Send a series of emails**
As noted previously, you have a lot to say to an attentive audience. Building a full welcome series (3–5 emails) allows you to keep each of them to the point while still covering all the information you want to share. It also fosters continued interest from the subscriber, which leads to continued positive engagement, boosted reputation, and improved deliverability.

**Get personal**
If you’re doing a series of welcome emails, use one of them to show the personal touch. Use any information you collected at sign-up or from their purchase to showcase how you can make their experience unique and more valuable to them. If you didn’t collect any data yet, use this as an opportunity to show what you could do if given the chance. Then, ask them for the information you need to enrich their experience.
