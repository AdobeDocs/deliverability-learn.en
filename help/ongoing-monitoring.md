# Ongoing monitoring

Here are some ways to help identify a possible issue where you might need expert support:

* There’s an observed spike in hard or soft bounces. This could be indicative of a block, black-listing, or other deliverability issue.
* There’s a noticeable decrease in open and click metrics while delivered rates remain high. This is indicative of potential bulk folder placement.
* There’s a significant increase in complaints. This can be caused by a poor-quality list source.
* You have any strategic initiatives that might impact deliverability. These include but aren’t limited to subscriber acquisition, engagement strategies, seasonal strategies or significant changes to frequency, and campaign type.
